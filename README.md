# Tennis-ML
Code to accompany my Thesis Project:
An Artificial Neural Network to Predict Tennis Match Outcomes from Short Samples of Play

Raw data sourced from https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject

Must download to run as data files are too big.

Run the Data notebook in order to generate points, matches, and input tables for sample sizes.
Run the ANN notebook in order to build and test the ANN.
