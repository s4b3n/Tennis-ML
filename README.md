# Tennis-ML
Code to accompany my Thesis Project:
An Artificial Neural Network to Predict Tennis Match Outcomes from Short Samples of Play

Raw data sourced from https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject

Must download to run as data files are too big. Note that the raw data provided is a slightly cleaned copy of the original data, with several '"' characters removed and 3 missing values in the Gm# column of the points-m table fixed.

Run the Data notebook in order to generate points, matches, and input tables for sample sizes.
Run the ANN notebook in order to build and test the ANN.
